# TensorFlow-Learn

## Goal

Repo for me to learn the TensorFlow API. Contains some useful abstracted TensorFlow common-usage classes, if only just "useful" in the informative sense.

## Ready-made classes

* Softmax-based regression
* TODO migrate TF GMM from final-proj-cos424 to here with nicer interface.

## Dependencies

`tensorflow numpy tabulate six sklearn matplotlib`

Relies on python3. Tested on 3.3+.

## Prepared data

Though not required, you may unzip `data.tgz` to recover the pre-trained CNN used in `notebooks/mnist.ipynb`. This also contains the MNIST data.
