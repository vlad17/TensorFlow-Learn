# TensorFlow-Learn

## Goal

Repo for me to learn the TensorFlow API. Contains some useful abstracted TensorFlow common-usage classes, if only just "useful" in the informative sense.

## Ready-made classes

* Softmax-based regression

## Dependencies

`tensorflow numpy tabulate six`

## Trained network

Contact vlad17 for the pretrained network files, which may be placed in `data/` for a ready network.
